## Node Web Scraper

This is my attempt to scrape JavaScript rendered website using NodeJS and Google's [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) project.

Didn't managed to deploy this to all 3 cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud & Azure) because they only support Node v6.x at this moment while I'm using async/await function which doesn't natively supported in the Node v6.x.
